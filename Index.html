    <p> Nobody knows just why we're here
Could it be fate or random circumstance?
At the right place, at the right time
Two roads intertwine
And if the universe conspired
To meld our lives, to make us fuel and fire
Then know wherever you will be
So too, shall I'll be
Close your eyes, dry your tears
'Cause when nothing seems clear
You'll be safe here
From the sheer weight
Of your doubts and fears
Weary heart, you'll be safe here
Remember how we laughed until we cried
At the most stupid things like we were so high
But love was all that we were on
We belong
And though the world would never understand
This unlikely union and why it still stands
Someday, we will be set free
Pray and believe
When the light disappears
And when this world's insincere
You'll be safe here
When nobody hears you scream
I'll scream with you
You'll be safe
Ooh, ooh
Ah-ha, ah
Save your eyes from your tears
When everything's unclear
You'll be safe here
From the sheer weight
Of your doubts and fears
Wounded heart
When the light disappears
And when this world's insincere
You'll be safe here
When nobody hears you scream
I'll scream with you
You'll be safe here
In my arms through the long cold night
Sleep tight, you'll be safe here
When no one understands
I'll believe, you'll be safe
You'll be safe, you'll be safe here
Ooh, ooh
Put your heart in my hands
You'll be safe hereNobody knows just why we're here
